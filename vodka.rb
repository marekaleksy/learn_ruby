puts "Let's check what is my IQ score."

puts "Some time ago I had 67.871"

puts "But since that day I was drinking so much vodka"

puts "So let's count:"

puts "Every litre of vodka is killing 9.73818361 grey matter."

puts "Every grey matter is 4.997 IQ entity."

puts "I drank since 23 years."

puts "Every day I was drinking about 1.18946318 litre of vodka."

puts "So, let's calculate:"

puts "What is 1.18946318 * 9.73818361? #{1.18946318 * 9.73818361}"

puts "So vodka killed my 11.583210844174479 grey matter."
puts "And now, let's multiply:"
puts "What is 11.583210844174479 * 4.997 ? #{11.583210844174479 * 4.997}"

puts "It means, that I lost 57.88130458833987 of my IQ."

puts "Therefore, what is my IQ score at present??. Just a moment."

puts "What is 67.871 - 57.88130458833987?"

puts "Well, ruby is saying, that it is:"
puts 67.871 - 57.88130458833987

puts "Oh, that's very very bad. I must stop drinking!"
